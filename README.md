# Speed School Student Developer Network

🏗️ Repos still under planning

### ⭐ Project Target

Here at the University of Louisville, the J.B. Speed School of Engineering is the home of our Copmuter Science majors. Being one myself, I want to create a platform that allows both myself (@lordruzki) and other students to share and easily access resources that can help us all succeed and go beyond what our classes teach us.

## 🗒️ Project Plan

A web application that unifies and organizes resources for programming. It would have links and refeences to information based on classes as well as resources to introduce more advanced topics.

Possible Future Features
---
- Support for other classes in the future
- Account creation with security allowing the user to save their classes
- A dedicated mobile application
- The application could also connect to a Discord server allowing the users/students to communicate within or without the web application.
