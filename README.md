# Speed School Student Developer Network

🏗️ Repos still under planning!

### ⭐ Project Goal

Here at the University of Louisville, the J.B. Speed School of Engineering is the home of our Copmuter Science majors. Being one myself, I want to create a platform that allows both myself (@lordruzki) and other students to share and easily access resources that can help us all succeed and go beyond what our classes teach us.

## 🗒️ V0.1 Plan

The first (non-release) version of the program will be built using a basic HTML format with a CSS background and small bits of JavaScript for the few scripts it would need.

Possible Future Features

- Support for other classes in the future
